# ember-rails-lite

ember-rails makes developing an [Ember.JS](http://emberjs.com/) application much easier in Rails 3.1+.

The following functionalities are included in this gem:
- Pre-compiling of your handlebars templates when building your asset pipeline.
- Includes development and production copies of Ember, ~~[Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data)~~ and [Handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js).
- ~~Includes [ActiveModel::Serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) for integration with Ember Data.~~

You can see an example of how to use the gem [here](https://github.com/keithpitt/ember-rails-example). There is also a great tutorial by [Dan Gebhardt](https://twitter.com/#!/dgeb) called "[Beginning Ember.js on Rails](http://www.cerebris.com/blog/2012/01/24/beginning-ember-js-on-rails-part-1/)" which is a great read if you're just starting out with Rails and Ember.js
